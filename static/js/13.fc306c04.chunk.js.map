Our founders, Reenaa Aroraa &amp; Renuka Arora, were exhausted by the\n              amount of waste, clutter, and mess they used to clean during the lockdown. The thought of\n              doing something which can reduce the clutter and make the space clean and calm came while\n              organizing their own house.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This hard work, Innovative ideas, dedication towards organizing,\n              and tidying up brought them to start their little start-up “Tidy Spaces”.\n              Changing your cluttered wardrobe into a tidy one and making your place a neat space makes\n              Reena have a sense of satisfaction and destressing. She with her mother’s support has\n              efficiently organized and styled their wardrobes in a better way and donated the extra clothes\n              to the ones in need.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Her continuous efforts in changing her living place to a clutter-free and\n              lively space paid off when people started taking notes and asking her for organizing tips. In\n              addition, requested her guidance in setting up closets and kitchens. The Demand and\n              acceptance from people made her initiate the idea of “Tidy Spaces”, in assisting them\n              in creating their own Happy Home.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Aboutus"],"names":["useEffect","window","scrollTo","className","src","require","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
