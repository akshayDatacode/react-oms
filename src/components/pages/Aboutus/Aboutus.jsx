              Since we’re all so busy these days, who has free time to allocate to organizing? We do!
              In our mission to create a functional and aesthetic balance, we bring out the potential in our clients’
              under-utilized, and often out of control, wardrobe and storage spaces.

              organization, our aim is to bring calmness to the chaos of everyday life. With the versatility to design
              spaces that range from feminine to masculine, classic to cutting-edge, we can ensure each client feels
              as if they have a dream boutique in their very own home.

              We always try to keep things organized and make our space clean, no matter how much we tidy it,
              always ends up as clutter. And, with lockdown slowly coming to a close, what better time to do
              something about it? Not only your place will look nicer, but you&#39;ll feel better about it.

            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
              It all started in 2020. Our founder, Reenaa Aroraa &amp; her mother-in-law, were exhausted by the sheer
              amount of waste, clutter, and mess they used to clean during the lockdown. The thought of doing
              something which can reduce the clutter and make the space clean and calm came while organizing
              their house. This hard work, Innovative ideas, dedication towards organizing wardrobes, and tidying
              up has brought us to start our own…………….
            </p>
            <p>
              This thought of changing your cluttered wardrobe into a tidy place made us feel so happy. She with
              her mother’s help efficiently used extra clothes to donate to those who are in need and to organize and
              style their wardrobes in a better way. Her continuous efforts in changing her living place to a neat and
              happy place paid off when people started taking notes and asking her for organizing tips. In addition,
              requested her guidance in setting up closets and different rooms at their homes. The Demand and
              acceptance from people made her initiate the idea of “My Happy Place”, in assisting them in creating
              their own Happy House.
