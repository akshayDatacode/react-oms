            When your wardrobe or its contents start to make you feel any kind of negativity, frustration,
            stress, overwhelm, or anxiety, it’s time to take action.
          </li>
          <li>
            These feelings can be caused by a number of scenarios, for example, disorder, too much
            crammed in, messiness, wrong positioning, not knowing what you have, and things not fitting
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our clothes should bring us happiness each day – they are a big representation of who we are,
            so if that stops happening, well, they aren&#39;t serving their purpose.

        <h5 className='my-5'>A step-by-step guide to organizing your wardrobe:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make your bed and tidy the room or area you are working in, otherwise, you may feel
            overwhelmed and defeated.
          </li>
          <li>Remove the contents of your section and lay them out on the bed in neat piles.</li>
          <li>Go through each and every item and make a decision as to whether you want to keep it, store
            it away (seasonal storage is a good idea), or get rid of (which can mean sell/give to a
            friend/donate to charity).
          </li>
          <li>Once you have gone through the entire rail you will probably have several (hopefully neat)
            piles around you. Give the inside of your wardrobe a good clean, let it dry, and then start to
            return the clothes.
          </li>
          <li>Place clothing back in categories and within those categories, a little color order.</li>
          <li>
            Position the clothing you wear most (day-to-day) in the most easy-to-reach places, for
            example, rails and shelves which are at eye level. The clothing you wear less, for example,
            black tie or holiday clothes, can ideally live in the harder-to-reach places (spare rooms,
            storage, or higher shelves and cupboards).
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure the items you wish to sell/donate/gift are clean and folded, ready to be sent away,
            or placed by the door so you remember to take them to the charity shop (plus, any items that
            need to be fixed/professionally cleaned).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 className='my-5'>Top tips for organizing your wardrobe:</h5>
        <ul className='my-5'>
          <li>
            Matching hangers give your clothes a uniform look and you are more likely to replace things
            neatly and keep up the organization if you have them.
          </li>
          <li>Slim, velvet hangers make room for more clothes and stop items from slipping off.</li>
          <li>
            You may find a few items that were hung would give you more space if they were folded, and
            vice versa.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think outside the box depending on the space you have - jeans work well in drawers folded as
            well as on shelves or hung, so look at the space you have as the ratio of rail compared to
            drawers and shelves determines what lives where.
