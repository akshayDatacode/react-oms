            As a Stylist, this is a big one for me. When I’m going through a client’s wardrobe, we’re not in there
            for the sole purpose of decluttering. There are other factors at play, we’re building a style and finding
            the pieces that match that, and removing the things that don’t.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re setting limitations for how much each person needs in their wardrobe before they start to feel
            overwhelmed with choice and we’re also thinking of ways we can make that space more user-
            friendly, providing less, what I love to call, mental clutter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compare your schedule with your wardrobe and see what you’re wearing before you do any
            decluttering.

                Consultation (Sometimes clients like doing the work themselves and just need the blueprint to
                do it. We can provide you with plans, product recommendations, and guidelines for your
                projects without any on-site assistance)

                Execution (From random piles of clothes to systemized shelves, this is where we shine. Not
                only do our organizational systems make your space look more appealing, but they can also
                reduce stress and free up more of your time)

                Unpacking (If you’re moving into a new home, you’re often focused on getting unpacked; not
                on neatly arranging your possessions and installing organizational systems. But that’s exactly
                what we focus on for you)
