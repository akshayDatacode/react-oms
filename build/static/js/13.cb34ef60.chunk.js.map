Our founder, Reenaa Aroraa &amp; her mother-in-law, were exhausted by the sheer\n              amount of waste, clutter, and mess they used to clean during the lockdown. The thought of doing\n              something which can reduce the clutter and make the space clean and calm came while organizing\n              their house. This hard work, Innovative ideas, dedication towards organizing wardrobes, and tidying\n              up has brought us to start our own…………….\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This thought of changing your cluttered wardrobe into a tidy place made us feel so happy. She with\n              her mother’s help efficiently used extra clothes to donate to those who are in need and to organize and\n              style their wardrobes in a better way. Her continuous efforts in changing her living place to a neat and\n              happy place paid off when people started taking notes and asking her for organizing tips. In addition,\n              requested her guidance in setting up closets and different rooms at their homes. The Demand and\n              acceptance from people made her initiate the idea of “My Happy Place”, in assisting them in creating\n              their own Happy House.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Aboutus"],"names":["className"],"sourceRoot":""}
